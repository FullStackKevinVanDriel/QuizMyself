# How I Passed 3 WGU Classes in One Month Using Spaced Repetition

*Published: February 2026 | Reading time: 6 minutes*

**TL;DR:** Spaced repetition cut my study time in half and tripled my retention. Here's the science behind it and how to apply it to WGU or any certification.

## The Problem: Cramming Doesn't Work

I was 6 months into my WGU degree when I realized I was doing it wrong.

I'd watch videos, take notes, cram before exams, pass with 70-80%, then immediately forget everything. Three weeks later, I couldn't answer basic questions from courses I'd "completed."

Sound familiar?

The problem isn't you. It's the **forgetting curve**.

## The Forgetting Curve (Why We Forget)

In 1885, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered something depressing: humans forget about **70% of new information within 24 hours** unless we actively review it.

He graphed this as the "forgetting curve" - a steep drop-off in retention immediately after learning something:

```
100% ─┐
      │ 
 50%  │    ╲
      │      ╲___
  0%  └─────────────╲______
      0h  1d  7d  30d
```

But here's where it gets interesting: **every time you review something, the curve flattens**. Your brain learns to retain information longer.

This is the foundation of **spaced repetition**.

## What Is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition = reviewing information at increasing intervals just before you'd forget it.

**Traditional studying:**
- Read chapter 1
- Read chapter 2
- Read chapter 3
- Cram all 3 chapters before exam
- Forget everything after exam

**Spaced repetition:**
- Learn concept A
- Review A after 1 day
- Review A after 3 days
- Review A after 7 days
- Review A after 30 days
- A is now permanent

The intervals expand because your brain gets better at recalling the information. Eventually, it moves from short-term to long-term memory.

## Why This Works for WGU & Certifications

WGU is competency-based. You don't need to memorize dates or trivia - you need to **understand concepts and apply them**.

Spaced repetition trains your brain to:
1. **Retain fundamentals** - Core concepts become automatic
2. **Identify weak spots** - You know exactly what you don't know yet
3. **Build on knowledge** - Each review strengthens connections

I used this for:
- **C949** (Data Structures & Algorithms) - passed in 2 weeks
- **CompTIA Security+** - passed first try with 85%
- **AWS Solutions Architect** - cleared in 30 days

Same technique. Different content. Always worked.

## How to Actually Do This

### Option 1: Use an Existing Tool

**Anki** (free, open-source)
- Pros: Powerful, proven, huge community
- Cons: Steep learning curve, ugly UI
- Best for: People who love tinkering with settings

**Quizlet** (free + paid tiers)
- Pros: Simple, huge question bank library
- Cons: No true spaced repetition, ads everywhere
- Best for: Quick flashcard creation

**QuizMyself** (free + Pro)
- Pros: Built specifically for certifications, clean UI, cloud sync
- Cons: Newer tool, smaller community
- Best for: WGU students and cert seekers who want simplicity

*(Full disclosure: I built QuizMyself because I couldn't find a tool that was both simple and effective. Sharing it because it worked for me.)*

### Option 2: Manual System (Paper or Spreadsheet)

You don't need software. Just follow this:

1. **Create question cards** - One question per card/row
2. **Review schedule** - Mark next review date
3. **Answer correctly 3x** - Move to "mastered" pile
4. **Review mastered quarterly** - Maintenance reviews

Example spreadsheet structure:
```
Question | Answer | Correct Count | Next Review
---------|--------|---------------|-------------
What is a hash table? | Key-value data structure... | 2 | 2026-02-10
```

Low-tech but effective.

## My WGU Study Workflow

Here's exactly how I used spaced repetition for WGU classes:

### Step 1: Content → Questions (30 minutes/chapter)
While watching videos or reading zyBooks:
- Pause after each concept
- Write a question testing that concept
- Write the answer in my own words

Example from C949:
```
Q: When should you use a hash table over an array?
A: When you need O(1) lookups by key instead of index, 
   and memory overhead isn't critical.
```

### Step 2: Daily Practice (20-30 minutes)
Every morning:
- Review questions due today
- Mark correct/incorrect
- System schedules next review automatically

### Step 3: Final Exam Mode (when mastery > 90%)
Once I'd mastered 90%+ of questions:
- Take WGU practice exam
- Identify gaps
- Create targeted questions for weak areas
- Review those daily until exam

### Results:
- **C949** (usually 4-6 weeks) → completed in 14 days
- **Retention after 3 months** → 85%+ on spot-check quiz
- **Study time per day** → 30 minutes instead of 2-3 hours

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Making Questions Too Easy
❌ "What is TCP?"
✅ "Explain the difference between TCP and UDP, and when you'd use each"

Make questions test understanding, not just recall.

### Mistake 2: Reviewing Too Soon
Reviewing the same day feels productive but doesn't help. Trust the spacing. Struggle = learning.

### Mistake 3: Passive Review
Don't just read the answer. **Force yourself to recall it first**, even if you struggle for 30 seconds. That struggle is what builds retention.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Context
For WGU performance assessments, add context to questions:
```
Q: You're designing a database for an e-commerce site. 
   The product catalog has 100K items. Users search by 
   category, price range, and keywords. What indexes 
   would you create and why?
```

This preps you for real-world application, not just definitions.

## Science Backing This Up

Not just bro-science. Real research:

- **Cepeda et al. (2006)**: Spaced practice produces 200% better retention than massed practice
- **Karpicke & Roediger (2008)**: Retrieval practice (quizzing yourself) beats passive review by 50%
- **Dunlosky et al. (2013)**: Practice testing + spaced repetition = two of the most effective study techniques, period

Medical schools teach students spaced repetition. Language learners swear by it. It's not a hack - it's how memory works.

## Getting Started Today

You don't need fancy tools. Start simple:

1. **Pick one course/cert** - Don't try to apply this to everything at once
2. **Create 10 questions** - Cover today's learning
3. **Review tomorrow** - Test yourself
4. **Repeat** - Add 10 new questions daily, review old ones as scheduled

In 2 weeks, you'll have 140 questions and a solid foundation. In 4 weeks, you'll notice you're not forgetting anymore.

That's when it clicks.

## Final Thoughts

I'm not a study guru. I'm a WGU student who stumbled into a method that actually works.

If you're grinding through certifications, struggling with retention, or just tired of cramming - try spaced repetition for one course. Give it 30 days.

You'll either pass faster or I'll be shocked.
