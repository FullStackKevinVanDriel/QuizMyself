# I Passed CompTIA Security+ in 3 Weeks With This One Study Hack

*Target: CompTIA certification seekers | Reading time: 5 minutes*

**The hack:** Stop re-reading the book. Start quizzing yourself daily with spaced repetition.

---

## My CompTIA Grind (Before Spaced Repetition)

Here's how I studied for Network+:
- Read Mike Meyers book cover-to-cover
- Watched Professor Messer videos (twice)
- Took practice exams until I scored 85%+
- Scheduled exam
- Passed with 78% (barely)

**Time invested:** 8 weeks  
**Retention 3 months later:** Maybe 30%

That's $370 (exam + study materials) for knowledge that evaporated.

## What Changed for Security+

For Sec+, I tried something different: **spaced repetition**.

The concept is simple:
1. Study a topic
2. Quiz yourself on it the next day
3. Quiz yourself again 3 days later
4. Quiz yourself again a week later
5. The material is now permanent

**Results:**
- Studied 3 weeks instead of 8
- Passed with 85% (first try)
- Retention after 3 months: 80%+

Same brain. Different method. Completely different outcome.

## Why CompTIA Exams Are Perfect for This

CompTIA tests practical knowledge, not trivia. You need to:
- **Understand concepts** (What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?)
- **Apply knowledge** (A user reports suspicious emails. What's your first step?)
- **Troubleshoot scenarios** (Network performance dropped after a config change. Where do you look?)

You can't just memorize definitions. You need concepts locked in long-term memory.

That's exactly what spaced repetition does.

## My 3-Week Study Plan

### Week 1: Foundation (Domains 1-3)
**Daily workflow:**
- Watch 2-3 Professor Messer videos (free on YouTube)
- Pause after each concept, create question
- Review previous days' questions (10-15 min)

**Example questions:**
```
Q: Explain the CIA triad and give a real-world example of each
A: Confidentiality (encryption), Integrity (hashing), 
   Availability (redundancy). Example: Bank website uses 
   HTTPS (confidentiality), checksums (integrity), 
   load balancers (availability).

Q: A user clicks a phishing link. What's the attack vector 
   and what's the first mitigation step?
A: Attack vector = social engineering (email). 
   First step = isolate user's machine from network, 
   force password reset.
```

**By end of week 1:**
- 70-100 questions created
- Domains 1-3 covered
- Daily review habit established

### Week 2: Expansion (Domains 4-6)
Same workflow, but now you're also:
- Reviewing Week 1 questions (spacing kicks in)
- Adding 10-15 new questions daily
- Identifying weak areas

**Key realization:** You start forgetting Week 1 material by day 10. That's when spaced repetition saves you - instead of re-reading chapters, you just quiz yourself for 5 minutes.

**By end of week 2:**
- 150-200 questions total
- All 6 domains covered once
- Retention of Week 1 material still strong

### Week 3: Mastery + Exam
**Days 1-4:** 
- Finish any gaps in domain coverage
- Take first full practice exam
- Create targeted questions for weak areas

**Days 5-6:**
- Review all questions (takes ~30-45 min now)
- Take second practice exam
- Should score 80%+

**Day 7:**
- Light review of weakest areas only
- Take exam
- Pass

## Tools That Work (Free + Paid)

### Option 1: Paper Index Cards (Free)
Old school but effective:
- Front: Question
- Back: Answer
- Rubber band into 3 piles: "Don't know", "Learning", "Mastered"
- Review "Don't know" daily, "Learning" every 3 days, "Mastered" weekly

### Option 2: Anki (Free)
Powerful open-source app:
- Pros: Mature, huge community, totally customizable
- Cons: UI from 2005, steep learning curve
- Download: https://apps.ankiweb.net/

### Option 3: QuizMyself (Free + Pro)
I built this specifically for cert studying:
- Pros: Simple, clean, cloud sync, mobile-friendly
- Cons: Newer tool, smaller community than Anki
- Try it: https://fullstackkevinvandriel.github.io/QuizMyself/

*(Bias alert: I made it because Anki's UI frustrated me. Free tier works great for single certs.)*

### Option 4: Professor Messer's Notes + Quizzes ($40-50)
Not spaced repetition, but solid:
- Pre-made questions aligned to exam objectives
- Worth it if you don't want to create questions yourself

**My recommendation:** Start with free (paper or QuizMyself), upgrade to Messer's notes if you need more content.

## Creating Good Questions (The Hard Part)

Bad questions don't help. Good questions lock in concepts.

### ❌ BAD: Definition Recall
"What does AES stand for?"

This tests trivia, not understanding. CompTIA doesn't care if you remember acronyms.

### ✅ GOOD: Concept Application
"Your company needs to encrypt customer PII at rest. What encryption standard would you choose and why?"

This tests:
- What encryption is appropriate (AES)
- When to use it (data at rest)
- Why (industry standard, strong, fast)

### ❌ BAD: Yes/No Questions
"Is WPA3 more secure than WPA2?"

Binary questions = 50% chance of guessing right.

### ✅ GOOD: Scenario-Based
"A small business wants to secure their WiFi. They have 10 employees and guest access requirements. What wireless security configuration would you recommend?"

Forces you to think through:
- WPA3 for employee network
- Separate guest network with WPA2 minimum
- SSID hiding (debatable, but good practice)

## Common Mistakes That Kill Progress

### Mistake 1: Passive Review
Reading your notes ≠ studying. **Actively recalling** from memory = studying.

Every question should make you struggle for 15-30 seconds. That struggle builds memory.

### Mistake 2: Only Using Practice Exams
Practice exams are great for **testing** knowledge, terrible for **building** it.

Use them as checkpoints (Week 2 & Week 3), not your primary study method.

### Mistake 3: Reviewing Too Soon
Reviewing the same questions 3x in one day feels productive but doesn't help long-term retention.

Trust the spacing. Review tomorrow, not in 5 minutes.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Performance-Based Questions (PBQs)
Sec+ has 5-10 PBQs (drag-and-drop, simulations). You can't quiz yourself for these.

**Solution:** Professor Messer has PBQ practice videos. Watch them Week 3, take notes on the process.

## The Science (Why This Works)

Not just anecdotal. Research-backed:

- **Karpicke & Blunt (2011):** Repeated testing (quizzing) beats repeated studying by 50%
- **Roediger & Karpicke (2006):** "Testing effect" - retrieval practice creates stronger memory traces than passive review
- **Dunlosky et al. (2013):** Practice testing = highest-utility study technique

Medical students use this to memorize thousands of terms. You can use it for ~500 Sec+ concepts.

## What You'll Notice After 1 Week

- **Day 3:** "Wow, I already forgot what subnetting is. Good thing I'm reviewing."
- **Day 5:** "I remember most of Week 1 stuff without looking. This is working."
- **Day 10:** "I haven't touched symmetric encryption in a week but I still know it cold."

That last one is the magic. Spaced repetition trains your brain to retain without constant review.

## Bonus: This Pays Off Forever

Here's what nobody tells you about CompTIA certs:

Security+ is a stepping stone. You'll use these concepts in:
- CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
- CISSP (if you get into security long-term)
- Actual job interviews

Cramming = pass exam, forget everything, relearn for next cert.

Spaced repetition = pass exam, retain concepts, build on them for next cert.

I used the same Security+ questions when studying for CEH 6 months later. Didn't have to relearn fundamentals. Just built on them.

## Getting Started Right Now

1. **Watch first Professor Messer video** (Security+ playlist on YouTube)
2. **Create 5 questions** from that video
3. **Quiz yourself tomorrow morning**
4. **Repeat daily for 21 days**

In 3 weeks, you'll have 100+ questions and solid fundamentals. That's when you schedule your exam.

**One Last Thing**

If you're studying for Sec+ right now, you don't need perfect notes or the perfect tool. You need consistency.

30 minutes a day for 21 days beats 6-hour Saturday cram sessions every time.

Start small. Build the habit. Pass the exam.
