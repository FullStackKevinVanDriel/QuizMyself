# YouTube Video Script: "I Built a Quiz App to Pass My WGU Classes Faster"

**Target Length:** 8-12 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording + talking head  
**Tone:** Casual, authentic, educational

## Hook (0:00-0:15)

*[Screen: QuizMyself app showing progress]*

"I was failing at WGU. Not actually failing - but I'd pass classes with 70%, then forget everything three weeks later. So I built this."

*[Quick cut: app demo, questions flipping, progress bar]*

"It's a quiz app with one feature that changed everything: spaced repetition. Here's how it works, and why it might help you too."

---

## The Problem (0:15-1:30)

*[Cut to talking head, casual setup]*

"Let me show you my WGU disaster. This was my study method:"

*[Screen recording: typical WGU course page]*

1. Watch all the videos
2. Take notes (that I never reviewed)
3. Cram before the exam
4. Pass with like 75%
5. Start next course
6. Already forgot the last course

*[Back to camera]*

"And here's the thing - I KNEW I was doing it wrong. I'd see people on r/WGU talking about finishing 3 courses in a month, and I was like... how?"

"Then I read about spaced repetition."

---

## The Discovery (1:30-3:00)

*[Screen: Simple diagram of forgetting curve]*

"Okay so there's this thing called the forgetting curve. Basically, your brain forgets like 70% of new stuff within 24 hours unless you review it."

*[Animate curve showing drop-off]*

"But - and this is the important part - every time you review something, the curve flattens. Your brain learns to hold onto information longer."

*[Show intervals: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days]*

"So spaced repetition is just: review stuff right before you'd forget it. And eventually, it sticks permanently."

*[Cut to camera]*

"Medical students use this. Language learners swear by it. And I'm sitting here re-reading the same chapter three times like an idiot."

---

## Existing Tools (And Why They Sucked) (3:00-4:30)

*[Screen: Anki interface]*

"So I tried Anki first. It's the gold standard for spaced repetition. Open source, powerful, huge community."

*[Click around Anki showing complex settings]*

"And... I hated it. Look at this UI. It's like someone designed software in 2005 and stopped updating it. Which, actually, is kind of what happened."

*[Show settings menu with 47 options]*

"Also, it has 47 different settings just for how often to review cards. I'm trying to pass C949, not get a PhD in flashcard algorithms."

*[Screen: Quizlet]*

"Then I tried Quizlet. Way simpler. But no real spaced repetition - just 'study mode' and 'test mode.' Plus, ads everywhere unless you pay $8/month."

*[Cut to camera]*

"So I did what any programmer does when tools suck: built my own."

---

## Building QuizMyself (4:30-6:30)

*[Screen recording: QuizMyself development, sped up]*

"I wanted three things:

1. Import questions fast - no fiddling with card formats
2. Spaced repetition that just works - no settings to tweak
3. Clean UI - I'm a developer, not a designer, but at least make it not ugly"

*[Show import screen]*

"Import: you can paste CSV, JSON, or just plain Q&A text. Or drag and drop a file. Takes like 10 seconds."

*[Show practice mode]*

"Practice mode: it shows you questions you haven't mastered yet. Answer correctly 3 times, it's mastered. Answer wrong, it resets."

*[Show spaced repetition scheduling]*

"Behind the scenes, it's scheduling reviews at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days intervals. But you don't see any of that - you just practice."

*[Show exam mode]*

"Exam mode: once you've mastered like 90% of questions, you take a final exam. 100% required to pass. It saves your progress so you can resume anytime."

*[Cut to camera]*

"That's it. No settings. No premium features locked behind paywalls. Just quiz, review, master."

---

## Results (6:30-8:00)

*[Screen: Show stats/progress from actual use]*

"So here's what happened when I actually used this for C949:"

*[Show timeline]*

"Week 1: Created 80 questions from the first 3 modules
Week 2: Added 60 more, still reviewing Week 1 stuff daily
Week 3: Hit 90% mastery, took the WGU pre-assessment
Result: Passed the actual exam after 14 days"

*[Cut to camera]*

"That course is usually 4-6 weeks. I did it in 2."

"But here's the crazy part - three months later, I spot-checked myself on those same questions. Still remembered 85% of them. WITHOUT reviewing for three months."

*[Show comparison graphic]*

**Before (Network+):**
- 8 weeks of study
- Passed with 78%
- Retention after 3 months: ~30%

**After (Security+):**
- 3 weeks of study
- Passed with 85%
- Retention after 3 months: ~80%

"Same brain. Different method. Completely different outcome."

## The Free Version vs Pro (8:00-9:00)

*[Screen: Pricing comparison]*

"So QuizMyself is free for up to 50 questions. That's enough for a single WGU course or one certification."

*[Show free tier features]*

"If you need more - like you're studying multiple certs or doing a bunch of classes at once - there's a Pro tier. $5/month or $49/year."

*[Show Pro features]*

"Pro gives you unlimited questions, 50MB of cloud storage, and you can export your quizzes if you ever want to switch tools."

*[Cut to camera]*

"Full transparency: I'm not trying to get rich off this. Five bucks barely covers hosting costs. I built it because I needed it, and now I'm just sharing it."

---

## Who This Helps (9:00-10:00)

*[Cut to camera]*

"This isn't for everyone. If you're already crushing your WGU classes in record time, you don't need this."

"But if you're like me - passing classes but not retaining anything, or spending 6-8 weeks per course when you know you could go faster - try spaced repetition for one course."

"Doesn't have to be QuizMyself. Use Anki if you don't mind the UI. Use paper index cards if you're old school. Just quiz yourself daily and see what happens."

*[Screen: Show QuizMyself landing page]*

"I put the link in the description. Free tier, no credit card, no BS. Try it for 2 weeks and see if it clicks."

---

## Closing (10:00-11:00)

*[Cut to camera]*

"Two last things:"

"One - if you try this and it helps, drop a comment. Or if you try it and it DOESN'T help, also drop a comment. I'm genuinely curious what works for different people."

"Two - I'm not a study expert. I'm just a WGU student who stumbled into something that worked. Take this, adapt it, make it yours."

*[Screen: End card with links]*

"Links below:
- QuizMyself (free)
- My blog post on spaced repetition
- r/WGU thread where I shared this

Thanks for watching. Now go pass some classes."

- Tweet with #WGU hashtag

### Day 3-5: Follow-up
- Post to r/CompTIA: "Spaced repetition cut my cert study time in half"
- Share on LinkedIn with professional framing
- Reply to every comment on YouTube

### Week 2: Repurpose

**Bottom Line:** Keep it real. You're not a YouTuber - you're a student sharing something that worked. Authenticity beats production quality every time.
