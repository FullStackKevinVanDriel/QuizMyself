# Reddit Marketing Strategy for QuizMyself

## Target Subreddits

### Primary (High-Intent, Low Competition)
1. **r/WGU** (170K+ members)
   - Pain point: Need efficient study methods for fast completion
   - Approach: "How I passed C949 in 2 weeks using spaced repetition"
   
2. **r/CompTIA** (200K+ members)
   - Pain point: Memorizing for A+, Network+, Security+
   - Approach: "Spaced repetition cut my Security+ study time in half"
   
3. **r/cert** or r/certification (community-specific)
   - Pain point: Multiple certs, need retention
   - Approach: "Stop forgetting what you studied - here's how"

### Secondary (Broader Reach)
4. **r/studytips** / **r/GetStudying**
   - Approach: Educational content about spaced repetition science
   
5. **r/selfhosted** / **r/privacy**
   - Angle: Self-hosted quiz platform with data control

## Post Templates

### Template 1: Success Story (High Engagement)
```
Title: I passed [Certification] in [timeframe] using spaced repetition - here's how

Body:
I'm a [background] who needed to pass [cert]. Traditional flashcards weren't cutting it - I'd cram, pass, then forget everything.

Then I discovered spaced repetition. The concept: review material just before you'd forget it. Your brain learns to retain permanently instead of temporarily.

I built a tool for myself (QuizMyself) and it changed everything:
- Cut study time by 50%
- Actually retained concepts long-term
- Passed on first try with 90%+

How it works:
1. Import your study material (CSV, JSON, or text)
2. Practice mode drills you on weak areas
3. Answer correctly 3x to "master" a question
4. Review at optimal intervals

It's free for basic use (50 questions). I upgraded to Pro ($5/month) for unlimited imports when studying for multiple certs.

Not selling anything - just sharing what worked for me. Hope this helps someone else grinding through certs.

### Template 2: Problem/Solution (Educational)
```
Title: Why you keep forgetting what you studied (and how to fix it)

Body:
Ever notice how you can ace a practice exam one week, then bomb it the next? That's not you being dumb - that's the forgetting curve in action.

Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered we forget ~70% of new info within 24 hours unless we review it. But here's the hack: reviewing at specific intervals trains your brain to retain permanently.

This is called spaced repetition. Anki users swear by it. Medical students use it. Language learners rely on it.

I built QuizMyself because existing tools were either too complex (Anki) or too simple (Quizlet). It's just:
- Import questions
- Practice
- Master
- Pass

Using it for [WGU classes / CompTIA certs / AWS exams]. Free tier works great for single courses. Pro ($5/mo) unlocks unlimited if you're studying multiple things.

Science-backed studying beats cramming every time.

### Template 3: Ask-First (Builds Trust)
```
Title: What study tools do you use for [certification]?

Body:
Currently studying for [cert] and curious what's working for others.

I've tried:
- Quizlet (too simple, no spaced repetition)
- Anki (powerful but overwhelming UI)
- Just reading notes (doesn't stick)

I ended up building my own tool (QuizMyself) for spaced repetition that's simpler than Anki. Works well for me but always interested in what others use.

What's your go-to?

## Posting Rules

### DO:
- **Be authentic** - You're a WGU student who built a tool you needed
- **Share first, promote second** - Lead with value (study tips, cert advice), mention tool naturally
- **Engage in comments** - Answer questions, give genuine advice
- **Post in relevant threads** - Find "how do I study for X" threads and provide helpful comments
- **Timing matters** - Post weekday mornings (8-10am EST) or evenings (6-9pm EST) for best visibility

### DON'T:
- **Spam** - Max 1 post per subreddit per month
- **Pure ads** - Every post must provide value beyond "try my tool"
- **Ignore comments** - Engage with everyone who replies
- **Cross-post identical content** - Customize for each community
- **Violate self-promotion rules** - Read subreddit rules first, follow 9:1 ratio (9 helpful comments : 1 promotional post)

## Seeding Strategy (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Establish Presence
- Subscribe to all target subreddits
- Comment helpfully on 10-15 posts (no self-promotion)
- Build karma and familiarity

### Day 3-4: Soft Launch
- Post Template 3 (Ask-First) in r/WGU
- Post educational content (Template 2) in r/studytips
- Engage heavily in comments

### Day 5-7: Value-First Promotion
- Post Template 1 (Success Story) in r/CompTIA
- Share specific tips in relevant threads
- Mention QuizMyself naturally when people ask

### Week 2+: Sustained Engagement
- 3-5 helpful comments per day across communities
- 1 value post per week in different subreddits
- Always answer questions about study methods

## Tracking Metrics

Monitor these weekly:
- **Reddit referral traffic** (Google Analytics or Plausible)
- **Sign-ups from Reddit** (tag links: `?ref=reddit-wgu`)
- **Engagement rate** (upvotes, comments per post)
- **Conversion rate** (visits → sign-ups → pro upgrades)

### Success Targets
- Week 1: 10+ engaged comments, 50+ referral visits
- Week 2: 100+ visits, 5+ sign-ups
- Month 1: 500+ visits, 20+ sign-ups, 2-3 Pro conversions

## Response to "Is this an ad?"

When called out (happens inevitably):

> "Fair question! I built QuizMyself because I needed it for my own WGU classes. Definitely biased since I made it, but genuinely trying to share what worked for me. 
> 
> Free tier is permanent - not trying to extract money from students. Pro tier just covers hosting costs for people who want unlimited imports.
> 
> Open to any questions about spaced repetition or study techniques in general."

Stay humble, transparent, helpful. Authenticity beats defensiveness.

## Long-Term Content Plan

### Monthly Posts (Rotate Topics)
1. **Study method deep-dive** - "The science of spaced repetition"
2. **Certification guide** - "How to pass Security+ in 30 days"
3. **Tool comparison** - "Anki vs Quizlet vs QuizMyself - which is right for you?"
4. **WGU-specific** - "Accelerating WGU: Study strategies that work"
5. **Success story** - Real user testimonials (with permission)

### Evergreen Comments
Keep these ready to paste (with customization) when relevant threads appear:
- "Best study tools for CompTIA certs"
- "How to retain information long-term"
- "WGU acceleration strategies"
- "Free alternatives to paid study platforms"

## Community Building

Once you have 50+ users:
- Create r/QuizMyself subreddit
- Encourage users to share study tips
- Feature community success stories
- Run challenges ("30-day mastery challenge")

This builds organic word-of-mouth and reduces reliance on promotional posts.

**Bottom line:** Be genuinely helpful. You built a tool to solve your problem. Others have the same problem. Share the solution authentically, not salesy.
