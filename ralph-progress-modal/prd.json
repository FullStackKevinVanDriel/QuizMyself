  "description": "Enhanced progress tracking modal in QuizMyself repo, via hamburger button (replacing roadmap). Aligns with best practices from Jira, Trello, GitHub: agile roadmaps with goals, flexible iteration, data-driven prioritization, visual timelines/milestones, stakeholder collaboration, automated integrations. Tracks issues (features, bugs, requests, questions) with IDs, API numbers, GitHub links, timestamps, SDLC progress. Features category filters, per-item progress bars, Vandromeda API feedback on GitHub opens. Items expand for lifecycle details (birth, events, timestamps). Logged-in users star items for API-tracked personalization.",
