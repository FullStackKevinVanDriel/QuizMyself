Story 2 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Story 2: Hamburger Button and Modal Setup - COMPLETED

### Acceptance Criteria Met:

1. **Add 'Progress' item to hamburger menu** - Already existed in both signed-in and signed-out menu states (index.html:2272, 2290)

2. **Load modal on click with flexible, visual layout (timelines, milestones)**:
   - Added **timeline visualization** with vertical connecting line and status dots
   - In-progress items have pulsing orange animation
   - Completed items show green dots
   - Added **milestone card** with SVG circular progress ring showing overall completion percentage
   - Milestone stats display open/in-progress/resolved counts

3. **Support frequent reviews/updates per best practices**:
   - Modal fetches data dynamically from Vandromeda API
   - Shows relative timestamps ("2 hours ago", "yesterday", etc.)
   - In-progress items are visually prominent with animation

### Files Changed:
- `index.html` - Added ~150 lines of CSS for timeline and milestone components, plus JavaScript for `renderTimelineItem()` function
- `tests/roadmap.spec.js` - Added 3 new tests for milestone card, timeline view, and renderTimelineItem function
