Story 4 implementation is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Story 4: Advanced UI and Filters - COMPLETED

### Acceptance Criteria Met:

1. **Category filters in modal (feature, bug, etc.)** 
   - Added a filter bar with type-specific chips (Features, Bugs, Questions, Requests, Feedback)
   - "All" filter shows everything by default
   - Filter chips show item counts and use type-specific colors when active
   - Filters toggle on click; clicking "All" clears other selections

2. **Expandable items showing full lifecycle: birth, events, timestamps, history** 
   - Roadmap items now have "View lifecycle details" toggle
   - Clicking expands to show lifecycle section with:
     - Birth event (when item was submitted)
     - Status change events (reviewed, development started, testing)
     - Full timestamps formatted as "Jan 15, 2026, 10:00 AM"
   - Events have colored left borders and icons based on type

3. **Visual elements: progress bars, dependencies, milestones** 
   - Item-level completion progress bar based on SDLC stage
   - Dependencies section renders if item has dependencies
   - Milestone card (from Story 2) continues to show overall progress

### Tests Added:
15 new Playwright tests covering:
- Filter bar display
- Filter toggle behavior
- Expandable items
- Lifecycle event display
- Progress bar rendering
- Function definitions and calculations
