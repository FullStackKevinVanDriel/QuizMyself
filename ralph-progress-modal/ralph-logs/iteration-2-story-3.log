Story 3 "Comprehensive Issue Tracking" has been implemented successfully. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Story 3: Comprehensive Issue Tracking - COMPLETED

### Features Implemented:

1. **Unique IDs for features, bugs, requests, questions**
   - Type-prefixed IDs: F-1 (feature), B-2 (bug), Q-3 (question), R-4 (request), FB-5 (feedback)
   - Styled badges with type-specific colors

2. **API registration, GitHub issue links, timestamps**
   - Metadata section showing API registration ID
   - Clickable GitHub issue links
   - Created date and relative "updated" timestamps

3. **SDLC stages with progress bars per item**
   - 5-stage tracking: Submit → Triage → Dev → Test → Deploy
   - Visual progress bar with green (completed) and orange pulsing (current) indicators
   - Stage labels displayed below progress bar

4. **Data-driven prioritization**
   - Priority scoring based on type (bugs highest), engagement metrics (stars, comments, views), recency, and GitHub linkage
   - Items sorted by priority within each status category
   - Priority badges: High (red), Med (orange), Low (gray)

### Tests Added:
- 11 new Playwright tests covering unique IDs, priority scoring, SDLC stages, and UI rendering
