Story #5 "Add category filters" has been implemented. Here's a summary:

## Implementation Complete

**Story #5: Add category filters** - All acceptance criteria met:

1. **Filter buttons for: All, Bugs, Features, Requests, Feedback** - Added filter chip buttons in the Progress modal header
2. **Active filter visually highlighted** - Active chips have cyan border and text color with highlighted background
3. **Filters work instantly (no reload)** - JavaScript toggles filter state and re-renders items without API calls
4. **Item count shown per category in filter buttons** - Each chip displays count (e.g., "Bugs (3)")
5. **Multiple filters can be active simultaneously** - Selecting Bug + Feature shows items from both categories

**Changes made:**
- `index.html`: Added CSS for `.progress-filters` and `.progress-filter-chip` classes, plus new functions `renderProgressItems()` and `toggleProgressFilter()`
- `tests/roadmap.spec.js`: Added 9 new tests covering all filter functionality

**Test results:** 93 tests passing (12 skipped AI tests)

**Commit:** f79d408 - `feat: add category filters to Progress modal`
