## Implementation Summary

**Story #4: Add progress bar for each item** - COMPLETED

### Changes Made:

1. **CSS (index.html lines 1949-1994)**:
   - Added `.item-progress` container with flex layout
   - Added `.item-progress-bar` for the track (dark background)
   - Added `.item-progress-fill` with gradient colors based on progress level:
     - `progress-10` (Open): Red gradient
     - `progress-40` (In Progress): Red → Orange gradient  
     - `progress-70` (In Review): Orange → Yellow-green gradient
     - `progress-100` (Resolved/Closed): Green gradient
   - Added `.item-progress-text` for the percentage display

2. **JavaScript (index.html `renderFeedbackItem()` function)**:
   - Added `progressMapping` to calculate percentage from SDLC status:
     - Open = 10%
     - In Progress = 40%
     - In Review = 70%
     - Resolved = 100%
     - Closed = 100%
   - Added progress bar HTML with dynamic width and color class

3. **Tests (tests/roadmap.spec.js)**:
   - Added 5 new tests verifying:
     - Progress bar displays 10% for Open status
     - Progress bar displays 40% for In Progress status
     - Progress bar displays 70% for In Review status
     - Progress bar displays 100% for Resolved status
     - CSS classes have gradient backgrounds

### All Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ Each item has a horizontal progress bar
- ✅ Progress percentage displayed (e.g., '75%')
- ✅ Progress calculated from SDLC stage: Open=10%, In Progress=40%, In Review=70%, Resolved=100%
- ✅ Progress bar has gradient color (red→yellow→green)
